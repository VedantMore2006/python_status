# python_status 🐍

Welcome to my Python playground! This repo is where I stash all the code from my Python learning journey—think mini-projects, practice scripts, and random coding experiments as I level up my skills.

## About
`python_status` is my personal space to track my progress in Python. Whether it’s a quick script to solve a problem, a mini-game I whipped up, or a data-crunching project, it’s all here. This repo is like my coding journal—sometimes messy, always fun, and full of learning moments.

## What’s Inside
You’ll find a mix of:
- **Practice Scripts**: Small programs to master Python basics (loops, functions, classes, etc.).
- **Mini-Projects**: Cool stuff like CLI tools, simple games, or data analysis scripts.
- **Experiments**: Random ideas I’m playing with, like web scraping or automation.
- **Challenges**: Solutions to coding challenges from sites like LeetCode or HackerRank.

Check back often—I’m always adding new stuff as I learn!

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python_status.git
   cd python_status
   ```
2. **Requirements**:
   - Python 3.8+ (most scripts should work with recent versions).
   - Some projects might need extra libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `requests`). Check each folder’s `requirements.txt` if it exists.
   - Install dependencies with:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
3. **Run a Script**:
   - Navigate to a project folder (e.g., `cd projects/tictactoe`).
   - Run the script with:
     ```bash
     python script_name.py
     ```
   - Some projects may have their own READMEs with specific instructions.

## Repo Structure
```

Each folder might have its own `README.md` or `requirements.txt` for details.

## Contributing
This is my personal learning space, so I’m not looking for contributions right now—just me and my code, vibing! 😎 But if you’ve got feedback or ideas, hit me up (see Contact below).
